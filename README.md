# Twitter Cat Chatbot

This is a generative chatbot using responses modeled from twitter posts about cats. It uses python3, Tensorflow, Keras to learn responses based on the sample text provided. While it's not perfect, the project is a start in the right direction for my learning in NLP and machine learning.
